April 12, 2011
I've decided to make version 0.6 the first 1.0 release
Many things have motivated me towards that.  While I was rewriting most of the PHP to optimize it and use less memory then it does (which is wayyy too much) I realized I was doing basically an entire rewrite of the backend.

I also came up with a few new ways to visualize the data better.  I'm still far from anything resembling a beta for the 2.0 release.  But hopefully I'll be able to get a link up with a small demo at the least.

And there should be a v2 branch in the source (there's nothing in it right now), but that's where all the source will go before I get some betas .rars built.

Hope you look forward to it.

## What is it? ##
nordlicht is a new front end for the AWStats. I grew tired of seeing the ancient interface currently used in AWstats, while the rest of the web evolved, and embraced new technologies such as HTML5, CSS2 & CSS3, and some pretty ace looking charting abilities.

So, I went about redesigning the front end, and this is what I came up with.

## New Charts ##
Using the Google Chart API we can greatly update the charts that AWStats produces:

Including a Map for those that use GeoIP

## Nicer Tables ##
The tables of the old AWStats were nice, but lacking.  The ones of nordlicht feature all the same information (sometimes more), and are easier on the eyes and include nice relevant icons for those that are needed.
